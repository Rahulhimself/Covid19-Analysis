# Covid19-Analysis
COVID-19 Data Analysis and Prediction
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data, including visualization of key metrics, trend analysis, and future predictions.

Project Description:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the impact and trends of the COVID-19 pandemic using data-driven methods. The analysis covers the infection and recovery rates, with a focus on visualizing these trends to provide a clear understanding of the situation. Additionally, the project uses time series forecasting to predict the number of cases in the near future based on current trends.

Features:
Data Analysis: Uses the Pandas library to analyze COVID-19 cases, including active, confirmed, and recovered cases.

Data Visualization: Leverages plotly to create visualizations that illustrate the trends of the pandemic.

Trend Analysis: Analyzes the rate of infection and recovery to identify key trends and patterns.

Future Predictions: Employs the Prophet library to build a time series model for forecasting the number of expected cases a week in the future.
